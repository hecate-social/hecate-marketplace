%%% @doc Mesh publish proxy for Marketplace daemon.
%%%
%%% Marketplace runs as a separate BEAM node and does not have direct
%%% access to the Macula mesh client (which lives in hecate-daemon).
%%%
%%% This module routes mesh publish requests to hecate-daemon via
%%% OTP pg process groups. The hecate-daemon registers a handler in
%%% the pg group 'marketplace_mesh_bridge' that forwards to
%%% hecate_mesh_client:publish/2.
%%%
%%% If hecate-daemon is not connected, publishes are silently dropped
%%% with a warning log.
